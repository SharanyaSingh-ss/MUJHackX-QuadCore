## Supply Chain and Logistics - Electric Scooter Sales and Distribution Platform (Powered by Bikesetu)
Create a solution to track electric scooters from manufacturer to customer and integrate AI-driven recommendations with a comprehensive CRM system to optimize sales and support processes.

### Tracking System
This project provides a system to track the lifecycle of electric scooters from the manufacturer to the customer. While the current system uses manual tracking, we propose integrating RFID technology for more efficient and automated tracking in future iterations. The system monitors scooter movement across various stages: Manufacturer → BIKESETU Yard → Franchisee Store → Customer.

### AI Advisor
AI-Advisor is a recommendation system designed to help users select the most suitable electric scooter based on their preferences. It offers personalized recommendations by analyzing factors like budget, primary use, usage duration, and scooter size/weight.

### CRM System
This project provides a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system designed to streamline and manage customer interactions, sales, and support throughout the lifecycle of electric scooters. The CRM system is currently integrated with Airtable for ease of use during development and testing, but for production environments, we recommend migrating to Salesforce or similar platforms for enhanced scalability, security, and customization.
